# ProjectEuler


An attempt to solve "many" (intentionally vague) ProjectEuler problems.(If you are not familiar with ProjectEuler, visit https://projecteuler.net/archives). All of the solutions are in Python/Sage. I'm sure some of them are horribly inefficient but they all adhere to the one minute rule of ProjectEuler. Posting these here mostly as a record for myself.
